# This mod will eventually contain 100 relics. I have sorted this To-Do list into smaller subsections

## Common Relics:

## Uncommon Relics:
- Mirror Shard [X] - At the start of each combat, create a copy of a random card in your hand

## Rare Relics:
- Gambler's debt [] - Card rewards have 2 extra cards, but 1 random card is disguised as a curse
- Sky's Death Spell [] - At the end of your turn, double the potency of your potions. If you use a potion, die next turn.

## Boss Relics:
- Hand of Midas [X] - Hand of Greed now grants double gold on kill. Upon pickup, upgrade all held Hand of Greed(s) and obtain 3 copies
- Thorned Crown [X] - Start each combat with 2 Thorns for each boss relic you have
- Dragon Heart [X] - Gain 2 Strength and 2 Dexterity at the start of each combat. Retain a random card at the end of your turn
- Flask of Duplication [X] - Upon pickup, gain 2 copies of Normality. Duplicate every card in your deck and gain 10 gold for each card added.
- Glimmering Orb [] - Every 5th power played each combat gives you 1 permanent Strength
