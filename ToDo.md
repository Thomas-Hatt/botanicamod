# This mod will eventually contain 100 relics. I have sorted this To-Do list into smaller subsections

## Common Relics:

## Uncommon Relics:
- Mirror Shard [X] - At the start of each combat, create a copy of a random card in your hand.
- Reality Shard [] - Right click to activate. Once per combat, you can switch your current draw pile with one from a random character.
- Tapinella [] - All Dexterity is converted to Strength

## Rare Relics:
- Gambler's debt [] - Card rewards have 2 extra cards, but 1 random card is disguised as a curse.
- Sky's Death Spell [] - At the end of your turn, double the potency of your potions. If you use a potion, die next turn.
- Jester's Belt [] - Gain 1 Dexterity for every 4 cards played in a turn, but lose 2 Dexterity if you play a Power card. Dexterity is now capped at 4.
- Alchemist's Mask [] - Right click to activate. Lose all gold. At the end of your turn, if you have 0 gold, obtain a random potion and add a random curse to your deck and draw pile.

## Shop Relics:
- Rainbow Cape [] - Card can be of any color, except your own character's. If you have Prismatic Shard, exchange it for a random rare relic

## Boss Relics:
- Hand of Midas [X] - Hand of Greed now grants double gold on kill. Upon pickup, upgrade all held Hand of Greed(s) and obtain 3 copies
- Thorned Crown [X] - Start each combat with 2 Thorns for each boss relic you have
- Dragon Heart [X] - Gain 2 Strength and 2 Dexterity at the start of each combat. Retain a random card at the end of your turn
- Flask of Duplication [X] - Upon pickup, gain 2 copies of Normality. Duplicate every card in your deck and gain 10 gold for each card added.
- Glimmering Orb [X] - The first time you play 5 Power Cards each combat, gain 1 permanent Strength
