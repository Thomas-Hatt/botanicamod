## Currently known bugs:
1. Images don't work
2. Jester's Belt does not cap the amount of Dexterity the player has (specifically, a Dexterity potion breaks the cap)
3. Jester's Belt does not reset the relic counter if the player has Dexterity equal to the Dexterity cap
4. When using a speed potion with Tapinella (5 temporary dexterity), the player still loses 5 dexterity
